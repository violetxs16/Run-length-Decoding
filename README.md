# Run-length-Decoding
The Run-Length(RLE) Decoding takes a compressed basic string and decompresses it. Each run of a repeated character is prefixed by a digit designating how many times the character should be repeated
Example, given input "10a" the output is "aaaaaaaaaa". The program can handle multiple digit prefixes.
